# SHAL — agent guide (add a device, no MCP needed)

*This ships **inside** the `pyshal` package. Print it with `shal docs`. Provider-neutral:
any agent can follow it — no Claude-specific tooling, no reading SHAL's source.*

> **Install `pyshal`, import `shal`.** The PyPI distribution is `pyshal`
> (`pip install pyshal[mcp]`); the Python module you import is `shal`
> (`import shal`). There is no module named `pyshal`.

SHAL is a **device-agnostic framework**: it ships the machinery, not devices. To control
a device you (1) **wrap its Python library as a small driver**, (2) **describe your setup
in a topology YAML**, then (3) **read/serve it**. The safety gate is built in: reads run
free, writes that touch hardware stop for a human.

## The fastest path: wrap a Python library as a driver

Most devices already have a Python library (a speaker → `soco`, a vacuum → a cloud
client, an instrument → its SDK). A driver is one small class that calls that library.

> **Mind the device library's own Python floor.** SHAL core runs on Python 3.10+,
> but a device's library may need newer. The maintained Deebot client
> (`deebot-client`) uses `asyncio.TaskGroup`, so it needs **Python 3.11+** — on 3.10
> its live commands fail. Make the venv on the version the *device library* requires
> (3.11+ for Deebot); no backport hacks.

> **Windows + MQTT drivers.** Every `shal` command (`probe`, `tools`, `mcp`) already
> sets the right event-loop policy. If
> you drive an `aiomqtt`-based device (e.g. Deebot) from your **own** script on Windows,
> the default `ProactorEventLoop` lacks `add_reader` (`NotImplementedError`); add one
> line before any asyncio call:
> `import asyncio, sys; sys.platform=="win32" and asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(asyncio.WindowsSelectorEventLoopPolicy())`

```python
# my_driver.py  —  a "root" driver: it wraps a library directly, no SHAL bus
import shal
from shal import Driver, idempotent, op

@shal.register                       # registers it in-process (no packaging needed)
class MyThing(Driver):                     # a capability is OPTIONAL — see below
    compatible = "community,my-thing"      # lowercase "vendor,part" — the binding key
    kind = None                            # root driver: no parent bus, wraps a lib
    llm_ready = True                       # REQUIRED: enforces @op metadata at load

    def bind(self, node):
        super().bind(node)
        self._addr = str(node.address)     # bind() ONLY reads config — NO I/O here
        self._client = None                # connect lazily (see rule 5)

    def _ensure_connected(self):           # connect ONCE, on the first real op
        if self._client is None:
            import the_library             # import + connect here, not in bind()
            self._client = the_library.Client(self._addr)
        return self._client

    # --- a READ (free): side_effect="none". MUST be live or raise (never a default) ---
    @idempotent
    @op("Read the current volume (0-100).", side_effect="none")
    def get_volume(self) -> int:
        v = self._ensure_connected().volume    # your library call
        if v is None:                          # no live answer / not ready? raise — don't guess
            raise shal.HopError("no response", path=self.node.path,
                                hop="lib", delivered="unknown")
        return int(v)

    # --- a WRITE: "write" = benign/instant (runs free); "actuator"/"config" = GATED ---
    @op("Set the volume (0-100).", side_effect="write")
    def set_volume(self, level: int) -> None:
        self._ensure_connected().volume = int(level)
```

### The five rules
1. **`@shal.register`** + **`compatible`** (`"vendor,part"`) bind the class to the YAML.
2. **`llm_ready = True`**, and every public method has **`@op("description", side_effect=...)`**.
   Private helpers start with `_`.
3. **`side_effect`** is the gate:
   - `"none"` → a **read** (free). A read **must reflect a live device response or raise
     `shal.HopError`** — never a cached/seeded/default value, and never an
     **empty / "no data yet" success** (raise instead; the device just isn't ready).
   - `"write"` → a **benign** write (instant, reversible — runs free).
   - `"actuator"` (physical motion) / `"config"` → **gated**: stops for human approval.
   - *Forget to annotate? It defaults to gated (fail-closed).*
4. **`@idempotent`** on a read lets the framework auto-retry it; never on a write.
5. **Connect lazily — never in `bind()`.** `bind()` only reads config; open the connection
   on the first real op via a guarded `_ensure_connected()` (above). Why: `shal tools` /
   `shal mcp` list the tool surface **offline** (tool metadata is static), so if `bind()`
   authenticates or opens a session, merely *listing* the tools forces a live round-trip —
   and fails when the device/cloud is unreachable. A cheap local handle is fine in `bind()`;
   anything networked must be lazy.

### Wrapping an **async** library (run it on a dedicated loop thread)
If the library is `asyncio`-based, do **not** call `asyncio.run()` / `loop.run_until_complete()`
straight inside a sync `@op`. Under `shal mcp` your op runs while the server's event loop is
already active, so a fresh loop run raises *"Cannot run the event loop while another loop is
running"* — and a one-shot loop also lets the library's background tasks (e.g. MQTT
subscriptions) die between calls. Run the library on **one persistent loop on a dedicated
thread** and submit coroutines to it:

```python
import asyncio, threading
# in bind(): self._loop = None
def _run(self, coro):                       # call from any @op, sync or under shal mcp
    if self._loop is None:                  # start the loop thread once, lazily
        self._loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
        threading.Thread(target=self._loop.run_forever, daemon=True).start()
    return asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(coro, self._loop).result(timeout=120)
```
The loop lives in its own thread, so the driver behaves identically under `shal probe` and
`shal mcp`, and long-lived subscriptions keep receiving while you poll for a live event.

### Capabilities are optional
Subclass a capability (`shal.MediaPlayer`, `shal.TemperatureSensor`, …) only when you want
your driver to be **interchangeable** with other drivers of the same kind. Otherwise just
expose `@op` methods — the agent sees them either way. (`shal.catalog()` lists what exists.)

---

## Describe the setup (topology YAML)

```yaml
shal_version: 1
root:
  my_device: {id: thing, driver: 'community,my-thing', address: '192.168.1.50'}
```
`shal.load()` also accepts this as an in-memory dict. Secrets go via `${ENV_VAR}` in a
`config:` block — never literal in the file, never in logs.

A cloud device (no IP to give) still needs an `address` — every node needs exactly one
of `address` | `routes` | `to`, even if `config:` holds the real connection details:
```yaml
shal_version: 1
root:
  vacuum: {id: vac, driver: 'community,my-thing', address: vac-serial-123,
           config: {account: '${CLOUD_ACCOUNT}'}}
```
Use a stable identifier — a serial number, account id, or the literal `"cloud"` — as
the address; `config:` alone does not satisfy the rule.

## Run it (no MCP host needed)

```bash
shal probe my.yaml --drivers my_driver.py                    # print device state and exit
shal probe my.yaml thing__get_volume --drivers my_driver.py # one named read (tool before --drivers)
shal tools my.yaml --drivers my_driver.py                   # list the tools (read / gated)
shal mcp   my.yaml --drivers my_driver.py                   # serve to an MCP host (the adapter)
```

> Tool names are `<node-id>__<op>` (e.g. `thing__get_volume`); several like devices
> disambiguate to `<id>_2__op`, `<id>_3__op`. Run `shal tools my.yaml` to see the exact
> handles — never hardcode them. A `--drivers <dir>` scan skips `_`-prefixed files; name a
> `_helper.py` explicitly on `--drivers` to load it.

Or in Python:
```python
import shal, my_driver          # importing my_driver runs @shal.register
with shal.load("my.yaml") as hal:
    print(hal.get_device("thing").get_volume())      # a read — free
```

---

## Verify before you trust it

```python
from shal import conformance
conformance.check_driver(MyThing)     # static + live sim checks; raises on a problem
```

The gate / approval flow (a write returns an `approval_required` ticket a human confirms)
is automatic — you don't wire it; you just classify ops with `side_effect`.

**Going deeper:** the full SDK (buses, transport kinds, limits, sims, conformance) is
bundled too — run `shal docs --sdk` (it ships in the wheel, like this guide).
