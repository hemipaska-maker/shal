"""``shal-mcp`` — serve a SHAL topology to any MCP host as gated tools (#25).

Thin stdio shell over `Bridge`. The `mcp` SDK is an optional extra
(``pip install pyshal[mcp]``) and is imported only when the command runs, so the
core package stays at two dependencies.

    shal-mcp lab.yaml                 # reads free, writes gated (default)
    shal-mcp lab.yaml --approve auto  # opt in to free writes (logged)
    SHAL_TOPOLOGY=lab.yaml shal-mcp   # topology via env

Register it with a host (example — Claude Code / Desktop ``mcpServers`` block):

    {"mcpServers": {"shal": {"command": "shal-mcp", "args": ["lab.yaml"]}}}
