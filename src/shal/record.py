"""The record — one result per unit, shared by bench and station (D22, `record.md`).

One record per **run of one sequence against one unit**, in one shape whether
pytest ran it at the bench or Bricks ran it on the floor. This module is the only
home for that shape, its writer and its reader; the runners import it and none of
them invents a shape of its own (`record.md` §3, §6 R1).

Invariants this file enforces — they are the contract, and the tests check them:

1.  **Every field of `record.md` §2 is required except `firmware` and `abort`.**
    A bench run is `unit="bench"`, never blank.
2.  **`verdict` is derived, never set by hand** — `aborted` if the run was stopped
    early, else `error` if a step raised, else `fail` if a step failed, else
    `pass`. It is a read-only property, so it cannot be constructed wrong; a
    stored record whose `verdict` disagrees with its own steps is a
    `RecordError`, not a silent correction.
3.  **Measurements carry the limits that were enforced**, copied in at the time.
    A record must be readable in a year without the topology.
4.  **`calls` is the AOS list as it exists, unchanged** — pass-through mappings,
    not a shape this module defines. It is checked only for being plain,
    finite, JSON/YAML-safe data, because that is what the round-trip needs.
5.  **Two stores, one truth: the YAML wins.** SQLite `records.db` is the index;
    `records/<id>.yaml` beside it is the audit copy. `read()` returns what the
    YAML says whenever a YAML file exists (`record.md` §4).
6.  **Fields are added, never renamed or removed**, and `record_version` is the
    first field so a reader knows what it holds (`record.md` §7). A record
    written by a *newer* version than this one is refused, not half-read.

Determinism: `started`/`ended` are ISO-8601 UTC **strings**, not `datetime` —
PyYAML would parse a bare timestamp back into a `datetime` while JSON would hand
back a string, so a `datetime` field could not round-trip identically through
both stores. Optional fields are omitted when unset (as `record.md` §2 itself
omits `min` from `limits: {max: 50}`), key order is the spec's order, and
non-finite floats are refused — together that makes the two serialisations of
one record byte-stable.

No consumer wiring lives here: `pytest-shal` (R2), Bricks/AOS (R3) and Predictor
(R4) import this module later. Nothing in `shal` imports it today.
