"""Driver base + @idempotent + bind-time capability wrapping (DECISIONS v2.1 #4).

Retry policy (DESIGN V2 decision 6): idempotent ops reconnect once / retry once;
a write is NEVER silently re-fired — HopError(delivered=...) propagates untouched.
The framework, not the driver, implements the retry machinery.

Observability (DESIGN V2 'Logging'): the wrapper is the single instrumentation
point for capability calls — txn assignment, DEBUG call traces, WARNING on the
handled retry, a DEBUG breadcrumb when raising (so a log-only reader sees the
failure; the ERROR-level raise-or-log rule is untouched), and the shal.audit
record for write ops on device drivers.
