"""Human-in-the-loop actuation gate (issue #14).

SHAL's promise — "it asks permission before it moves" — is enforced HERE, at the
same capability-wrapper chokepoint where limits and audit already fire. For an op
whose effective ``side_effect`` is ``"actuator"`` (physical motion), the wrapper
consults the active :class:`Approver` AFTER the limit check and BEFORE any bus
I/O. Because the gate lives in the wrapper, NO call path can bypass it — the tool
surface (``hal.call_tool``) and the raw path (``get_device().method()``) go
through the exact same enforcement.

SHAL ships the *mechanism* and a *safe default* (ask on the terminal when
interactive; deny when there is no one to ask — a pipe, a cron job, CI). The host
injects the *decision*:

    import shal
    shal.set_approver(shal.AutoApprove())          # sim / CI / tests
    with shal.approver(MyNanoClawApprover()):       # scoped policy
        ...

Order is always **limits -> approval -> I/O**: an impossible call is rejected by
limits before anyone is asked to approve it. Every decision (allow or deny) is
written to ``shal.audit`` so runs stay deterministic and replayable.

**Pair this with the gated set — the one trap in this design (issue #114).** There
are TWO policies here, not one, and they answer different questions:

* ``set_approver`` / ``approver`` — WHO decides (this module).
* ``shal.set_gated_effects`` / ``shal.gated_effects`` — WHICH effects even reach
  that decision (``shal.driver``; default ``{"actuator", "config"}``).

A host that seats one and forgets the other gets weaker enforcement than it
thinks. Seating a strict Approver alone still lets every ``side_effect="write"``
op through untouched — it is never gated, so the Approver is never asked::

    shal.set_approver(MyHumanApprover())               # WHO
    shal.set_gated_effects({"write", "actuator", "config"})  # WHICH — don't forget

Both live in :class:`~contextvars.ContextVar`\\ s with the same caveat: a newly
spawned OS thread inherits neither and falls back to the safe defaults.
