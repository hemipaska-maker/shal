"""Check the *built wheel's* metadata against what ``src/shal`` actually needs
(shal#123).

CI installs `.[dev]` from a repo checkout, so it never once installs the
thing pip actually ships. That gap is not hypothetical: pyshal 0.2.1 declared
`mcp>=1.0` with no upper bound, and `pip install "pyshal[mcp]"` broke on
every fresh install for 34 days while every test stayed green (#105/#106) —
because no test ever installed the wheel and imported it.

An in-repo test can't fix this: it would re-open pyproject.toml and assert a
substring, which just restates the diff and passes just as happily with a
wrong bound. So this script reads the *built artifact* instead — the wheel's
``Requires-Dist``, from its own METADATA — and checks two things:

1. Every third-party import that runs at module scope in ``src/shal`` (i.e.
   at `import shal` time) is a declared dependency. A **lazy** import — one
   nested inside a function or method body, like the `mcp` SDK import in
   `src/shal/mcp/server.py` or the `jsonschema` import in
   `src/shal/loader.py:_validate_schema` — only breaks the feature that
   calls it, not `import shal`, so it is deliberately NOT required to be
   module-scope-visible here. The axis is module-scope vs. lazy, not
   "imported anywhere".

2. Every declared dependency (base install and extras) has an upper bound,
   or a written, reviewed exemption in `UNBOUNDED_EXEMPT` below. An
   unbounded floor is exactly the shape that caused #105: `mcp>=1.0` let a
   `2.x` in.

Usage:
    check_dist.py DIST_DIR

``DIST_DIR`` must hold exactly one built wheel (the output of
``python -m build``, e.g. ``dist/``). Exit 0 on success, 1 with the specific
failures listed on stderr otherwise.
