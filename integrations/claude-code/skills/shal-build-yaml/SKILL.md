# Build a SHAL topology YAML

## Mental model

One tree. **A bus is just a node that provides a transport to its children.**
Where your Python runs is the root; every hop toward a device (ssh, I2C
controller, cloud portal, mux channel) is a nested node.

```yaml
shal_version: 1            # required, literal 1
root:
  <node-name>:             # lowercase [a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]*
    driver: vendor,name    # REQUIRED for every functional node
    address: <per-family>  # exactly one of: address | routes | to
    id: stable_handle      # optional, globally unique, survives moves
    config: {...}          # optional driver/bus parameters (see Secrets)
    children: {...}        # devices reached THROUGH this node
```

## Procedure

1. **Read the schema first**: `src/shal/schema/shal-v1.schema.json` is the source
   of truth for allowed keys. Semantic rules (id uniqueness, address grammar,
   driver installed) are enforced by the loader, not the schema.
2. **Walk the physical path** from the PC to each device; every hop becomes a
   nesting level. If you can't say what carries the bytes between two nodes,
   the tree is wrong.
3. **Pick drivers by `compatible`**. Bundled buses: `shal,local`, `shal,ssh-host`,
   `shal,i2c-cli`, `shal,spi-cli`, `shal,tcp`, `shal,http`, `shal,scpi-raw`,
   `shal,sim-i2c`, `shal,sim-scpi`, `shal,sim-msg`, `nxp,pca9548` (mux). Bundled
   device drivers: `ti,tmp102`, `ti,ina219`, `ti,ads1115`, `microchip,mcp9808`,
   `microchip,mcp23017`, `rigol,dp832`, `keysight,34461a`. The **authoritative,
   always-current** list is `shal.catalog()` (`{"buses": [...], "drivers": [...]}`).
   A driver must be installed (entry point group `shal.drivers`) or explicitly
   registered — an unknown compatible fails the load.
4. **Address per bus family**: I2C `0x03`–`0x77` (int), i2c-cli `/dev/i2c-<n>`,
   spi-cli `/dev/spidevX.Y`, ssh `user@host`, tcp `host:port`, http(s) a URL.
   The PARENT validates the child's address at load.
5. **Give ids** to anything user code will look up: `hal.get_device("<id>")`.
   Path = location, id = identity; moving a device changes its path, never its id.
6. **Mux channels** are address-only nodes (no `driver:`) under the mux node.
7. **Validate by loading** — the loader IS the validator:
   ```python
   import shal; shal.load("setup.yaml")
   ```
   Every failure is a `LoadError` whose message names the node path and the fix.

## Agent metadata (optional)

Two optional node keys shape the LLM tool surface (`hal.tool_schemas()`), not the
topology itself:
- `description:` — instance context blended into every tool description on that node,
  so an agent tells *like* devices apart ("Coolant inlet, loop A" vs "Ambient room").
- `expose: false` — omit this node's ops from the agent surface
  (`tool_schemas` / `tool_catalog` / `call_tool`). Still fully usable from Python.

```yaml
ambient:
  id: coolant_inlet
  description: Coolant inlet temp, loop A. Alarm > 60 C.   # → into the tool description
  driver: ti,tmp102
  address: 0x48
mux_ctrl:
  expose: false        # plumbing the agent should never call
  driver: ...
```

Capability/op metadata (units, side-effects) comes from the DRIVER (`@shal.op`),
never the YAML — see shal-build-driver.

## Secrets (non-negotiable)

Secrets never live in topology files. Use `${ENV_VAR}` references in `address`
or `config:` values — resolved from the environment at load; a missing variable
fails the load naming the VARIABLE, never a value. Literal values in `config:`
are permitted only for files that never leave the machine.

```yaml
config:
  user: ${ECOVACS_EMAIL}        # recommended
  password: ${ECOVACS_PASSWORD}
```

## Installation safety limits: `config.limits` (rig policy, tighten-only)

A node may TIGHTEN a driver's declared operating limits — the rig owner caps a
32 V-capable PSU feeding a 3.3 V board, with no driver edit:

```yaml
psu_3v3:
  driver: rigol,dp832
  address: 1
  config:
    limits:                 # reserved key: consumed by the framework, not the driver
      set_voltage:
        volts: {maximum: 5.0}   # 5.0 <= the driver's 32.0 -> loads; effective max 5.0
```

The effective (tightest) limit is what agents see in `tool_schemas()` and what
the framework enforces before any I/O. **Widening fails the load** naming both
numbers — YAML can never make a rig more dangerous than the datasheet. Keys
must name real ops/params of the bound driver (checked at load).

## Things that fail the load by design

- `routes:` (failover) — parses but rejects: Phase 2.
- `insecure: true` missing on a plaintext `http://` or tcp bus.
- Duplicate `id`, unknown `compatible`, malformed address, unresolved `$ref`,
  unknown node keys (schema is `additionalProperties: false`).
- `config.limits` that widens a declared limit, or names unknown ops/params.

## Reusing a board: `use:` includes

To graft a reusable subtree (a board, a rack module) without copy-paste, put it
in its own file under a top-level `template:` node, then `use:` it:

```yaml
# boards/tmp102-board.yaml
shal_version: 1
template:
  driver: shal,sim-i2c
  address: "${busname}"            # quote ${...} inside flow maps (YAML quirk)
  children:
    temp0: { id: "${inst}_temp", driver: ti,tmp102, address: 0x48 }
```

```yaml
# setup.yaml
root:
  board_a:
    use: boards/tmp102-board.yaml
    with: { inst: a, busname: sim0 }   # ${param} substitution -> id a_temp
    address: sim9                      # use-site keys OVERRIDE the template
```

Rules: the template is the base, use-site keys override it; `with:` params resolve
before env `${VAR}`s; includes may chain and nest; cycles fail loudly; paths are
relative to the including file and may not escape the top-level file's directory.
Include the same board twice → namespace its ids via a `with:` param, or you'll
hit the duplicate-id error.

## Composing a setup from many files: `include:`

`use:` grafts one template **into a node**. `include:` is different: a
top-level list of relative paths, each a full topology with its own `root:`.
Those `root:` maps merge as **siblings** into this file's `root:` — nothing
nests, and there is no override:

```yaml
# device_a.yaml
shal_version: 1
root:
  device_a: { driver: shal,sim-i2c, address: sim0, children: { ... } }
```

```yaml
# setup.yaml
shal_version: 1
include:
  - device_a.yaml
  - device_b.yaml
```

Add a device by adding a file and one line to `include:` — no editing an
existing file's `root:`. Rules: a top-level name defined in two files (main or
included) is a `LoadError` naming both files, so include order never matters;
paths are relative to the including file and may not escape the top-level
file's directory (same rule as `use:`); include chains are allowed, and a
cycle fails loudly naming the chain; only the **main** file's `.env` is read —
an included file's own sibling `.env` is never consulted; `include:` does not
take `with:` (a parametrised board goes under a named node with `use:`
instead). A main file may consist of nothing but `include:` entries.

## Disambiguating drivers: `from:`

If two installed packages both provide the same `compatible`, the load fails
naming both. Pin the one you want with a node `from: <distribution-name>`.

## Back-links / cycles

A node that points BACK to an existing node (PC ssh'ing to the server) is a
`$ref`, never a nested copy: `to: $lab_server`. Refs are name pointers; they
are never routed through.
