# SHAL

### A test sequencer an agent can drive — safely.

**One file describes everything your test touches** — the board on the bench, the
database behind it, the service it calls — with the risk of each operation written
down. Run it from Python or pytest at the bench. Hand it to an AI agent as typed,
gated tools: reads run free; **anything that moves or reconfigures stops for a person.**

> Behind the door: SHAL is the capability layer for AI agents operating engineering
> and production systems — hardware and software through one governed interface.
> Testing is the first use. The moat is one word: *physical*.

> In a blind test, an agent wrote working, safety-checked drivers for **4 of 4**
> devices from documentation alone — then drove a **real robot, gated**.
> *Founder-run, not yet independently replicated.*

### [→ Try it in 60 seconds — no hardware required](#quick-start)

</div>

**Built for:**

✓ Validation & test engineers who already write Python &nbsp;·&nbsp; ✓ Production test stations &nbsp;·&nbsp;
✓ Labs with mixed hardware + software &nbsp;·&nbsp; ✓ AI agent builders who need a gate before the wire

---

## From glue scripts to agent tools — in three steps

**Step 1 · Today, without SHAL** — a separate library, address, and retry per device:

```python
sensor  = TMP102(i2c_bus, 0x48)
supply  = SCPIPowerSupply("10.0.0.50:5025")
results = RESTClient("https://mes.lab.internal")
# ...and you wire each one's retries, logging, and tool-wrapper by hand
```

**Step 2 · With SHAL** — describe the rack once, then call devices by name:

```python
hal = shal.load("lab.yaml")

hal.get_device("ambient_temp").read_celsius()       # I²C sensor
hal.get_device("dut_power").set_voltage(3.3)        # SCPI supply
hal.get_device("results_db").record(status="pass")  # HTTP service
```

> **Validation & test engineers can stop here.** One model for the whole rack —
> no agent needed, no transport code, no glue.

**Step 3 · Hand the same rack to an agent** — the tool catalog is generated for you:

```python
tools = hal.tool_schemas()                           # one typed tool per device op
hal.call_tool("dut_power__set_voltage", {"volts": 3.3})
```

> Writes are gated, reads aren't. The agent never sees SCPI, I²C, or an address.

---

## Why existing agent frameworks fall short

Most agent tooling assumes **software-only** tools: APIs, databases, functions.
The moment a tool is a *physical* device — a sensor on I²C, an instrument over a
raw socket, a robot behind a network hop — you're on your own.

SHAL exposes physical devices, remote labs, instruments, **and** software
services as the *same* kind of tool — with the safety rails physical actions
need: gated writes, honest failure, a full audit trail.

---

## One model for hardware *and* software

The core idea is small:

> **A bus is just a node that provides a transport to its children.**

A sensor on I²C and an HTTP service are the same kind of node. Your code — and
your agent — calls **capabilities** (`read_celsius()`, `set_voltage()`), never
transports. `[core]` ships with SHAL; `[pkg]` is a driver you install or write.

```yaml
# lab.yaml — hardware and software in ONE graph
shal_version: 1
root:
  bench:                         # one SSH hop to the bench controller       [core]
    driver: shal,ssh-host
    address: ${BENCH_SSH}        # secrets resolve from the environment, never logged
    children:
      i2c0:                      # I²C rendered as argv over the SSH hop      [core]
        driver: shal,i2c-cli
        address: /dev/i2c-1
        children:
          ambient: { id: ambient_temp, driver: ti,tmp102, address: 0x48 }   # [core]

  instruments:                   # raw-socket SCPI bus                        [pkg]
    driver: acme,scpi
    address: 10.0.0.50:5025
    children:
      supply: { id: dut_power, driver: keysight,e36312, address: ch1 }       # [pkg]

  services:                      # HTTPS to internal services                [core]
    driver: shal,http
    address: https://mes.lab.internal
    children:
      results: { id: results_db, driver: acme,mes-results, address: api/v2 } # [pkg]
```

Every node is reached the same way — `hal.get_device("dut_power").set_voltage(3.3)`
— sensor or database, local or across the network. Same retries, same logs. Swap
any node for its sim and **nothing in your code changes**.

---

## Features

- **Agent-native** — every device op becomes a gated LLM tool.
- **Asks before it moves** — actuator & destructive/config ops stop for a
  host-supplied approver (CLI prompt, an agent, or auto in sim/CI); the gate is
  pre-I/O and unbypassable.
- **Hardware + software, one graph** — a sensor and an HTTP service are the same node.
- **Capabilities, not wires** — call `read_celsius()`, never I²C.
- **Retry you can trust** — reads auto-retry; risky writes never silently repeat.
- **Sim-first** — test the whole rack with zero hardware.
- **Recursive** — muxes, jumpboxes, nested buses: one primitive, no special cases.
- **Drivers as plugins** — add a device in one small class.
- **Secure by default** — no shell strings, TLS on, secrets via `${ENV}`.
- **Observable** — structured logs, one `txn` id per call.

---

## Install

> SHAL is in **alpha** (Phase 1).

```bash
pip install pyshal      # package is `pyshal`; you import it as `shal`
```

```python
import shal
```

For development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/determlab/shal && cd shal
pip install -e ".[dev]"   # pytest, ruff
```

Requires **Python ≥ 3.10** for SHAL core. A device's own library may need newer — the
featured Deebot path (`deebot-client`) needs **3.11+** (`asyncio.TaskGroup`); build that
venv on 3.11+. Dependencies: `pyyaml`, `jsonschema`.

---

## Quick Start

Runs with **zero hardware** — the simulated bus ships with SHAL. New to hardware?
This is the whole setup, and it's just Python and a YAML file.

```yaml
# sim.yaml
shal_version: 1
root:
  bus:
    driver: shal,sim-i2c
    address: sim0
    children:
      temp0:
        id: ambient_temp
        driver: ti,tmp102
        address: 0x48
```

```python
import shal

with shal.load("sim.yaml") as hal:
    print(hal.get_device("ambient_temp").read_celsius())   # 25.0
```

```bash
$ python quickstart.py
25.0
```

When the real board arrives, change `shal,sim-i2c` → `shal,i2c-cli`. **Your
Python doesn't change.**

---

## Reuse a board — `use:` and `with:`

A bench description isn't text you paste into the next project. It's a file the
next project points at.

Describe the board once, with `${param}` placeholders for whatever differs:

```yaml
# board.yaml
shal_version: 1
template:                       # a `use:` target must define `template:`
  driver: shal,sim-i2c
  address: sim0
  children:
    temp:
      id: ${prefix}_temp
      driver: ti,tmp102
      address: 0x48
```

Then reference it as many times as you need:

```yaml
# rig.yaml
shal_version: 1
root:
  bench_a: { use: board.yaml, with: { prefix: a } }
  bench_b: { use: board.yaml, with: { prefix: b } }
```

```python
import shal

with shal.load("rig.yaml") as hal:
    print(hal.get_device("a_temp").read_celsius())   # 25.0
    print(hal.get_device("b_temp").read_celsius())   # 25.0
```

Both benches come up as separate devices, and each op becomes its own agent tool
(`a_temp__read_celsius`, `b_temp__read_celsius`).

**The second bench is a reference, not a copy** — fix `board.yaml` and every rig
that uses it is fixed.

Details worth knowing:

- **`${param}` substitutes into every string in the template, including `id`.**
  That is how you avoid the global duplicate-id error when the same board appears
  twice: give each instance its own prefix.
- **The using node's own keys override the template's**, so a rig can change one
  address without editing the board file.
- **Includes chain** — a template may itself be a `use:` node. Cycles are
  detected and refused.
- **Paths are confined to the topology root.** A `use:` that escapes it via `../`
  is an error, not a warning.
- Values not supplied by `with:` fall back to `${ENV_VAR}` resolution.

---

## Drive it from an agent (MCP)

Expose a whole topology to an MCP host (Claude Code/Desktop, …) as gated tools —
no glue:

```bash
pip install "pyshal[mcp]"
shal mcp lab.yaml            # reads run free; writes ask a human first
```

Register it with your host (example `mcpServers` block):

```json
{"mcpServers": {"shal": {"command": "shal", "args": ["mcp", "lab.yaml"]}}}
```

Now tell the agent *"read the DUT temperature"* (runs immediately) or *"set
3.3 V"* — a write **pauses**: the agent gets an `approval_required` ticket and a
human approves the `shal_approve` tool before anything reaches hardware. Opt into
free writes with `--approve auto` (the choice is recorded in the audit log).

**Already own a device with a Python library?** Wrapping it as a SHAL driver is a
few lines — see the ready-to-edit examples in [examples/demos/](https://github.com/determlab/shal/tree/main/examples/demos/)
(a Sonos speaker, a Deebot vacuum), then point SHAL at your topology:

```bash
shal probe my-setup.yaml   # one-shot: print your devices' state, then exit
shal mcp   my-setup.yaml   # or serve it to an AI host (writes gated)
```

---

## Write a driver in 30 seconds

Need a device SHAL doesn't have yet? A driver is one small class. This is the
*entire* bundled temperature-sensor driver:

```python
from shal import Driver, TemperatureSensor, registry, idempotent, op, ByteTransport, Read, Write

@registry.register
class Tmp102(Driver, TemperatureSensor):
    compatible = "ti,tmp102"          # matched against the YAML `driver:` field
    kind = ByteTransport
    llm_ready = True

    @idempotent                        # a read: safe to auto-retry across drops
    @op("Read the ambient temperature now.", unit="celsius", side_effect="none")
    def read_celsius(self) -> float:
        raw = self.bus.txn(self.addr, [Write(b"\x00"), Read(2)])
        return ((raw[0] << 4) | (raw[1] >> 4)) * 0.0625
```

That's it — register the `compatible`, implement the capability. The `@op`
metadata is what makes it show up as a gated agent tool. SHAL discovers your
driver via the `shal.drivers` entry point.

---

## How It Works

A topology is a tree, and **every edge is a bus** — itself a node that carries
traffic to its children. You call a capability; SHAL translates it down the stack
to the wire and hands the result back up. No layer leaks into the one above.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as Your code
    participant T as tmp102 driver
    participant I as i2c-cli bus
    participant S as ssh-host bus
    U->>T: read_celsius()
    T->>I: read register 0x00
    I->>S: i2ctransfer 0x48 … (argv)
    Note over S: runs on lab_server
    S-->>I: raw bytes
    I-->>T: raw bytes
    T-->>U: 22.5 °C
```

Because every hop is the same primitive, an SSH jumpbox, an I²C mux, and an
in-process sim all compose — no special cases.

---

## Core Concepts

| Concept | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Node** | Anything in the tree: a device, a bus, a board. |
| **Bus** | A node that provides a transport to its children (I²C, SSH, HTTP…). |
| **Driver** | Bound to a node by its `compatible` string. Implements a capability. |
| **Capability** | The typed API your code calls (`read_celsius()`), independent of transport. |
| **id vs path** | `id` is a stable name for lookup; `path` is where it sits. Move a device, keep its `id`. |

```python
hal.get_device("ambient_temp").read_celsius()   # by semantic id — no wires leak in
```

---

## Real-World Use Cases

- **AI agents with real-world access** — expose a lab or robot to an LLM as
  gated tools; every actuator call stops for a human (or policy) to approve
  before it fires, and a delivery-unknown write is never silently retried.
- **Validation & test racks** — one model for eval boards, instruments, and the
  results database; test against sims in CI before hardware.
- **Manufacturing lines** — same capability calls across stations; one audit
  trail (`shal.audit`) for every actuator command.
- **Remote & distributed setups** — drive hardware behind an SSH jumpbox with
  nothing on the far side but standard CLI tools.
- **Robotics bringup** — start against a sim, swap in transports as boards land,
  without rewriting control code.

---

## FAQ

**Why not just wrap Python libraries as agent tools myself?**
You can — until there are ten devices on four transports, some behind an SSH hop,
some not. Then you're hand-maintaining a tool wrapper, address, retry policy, and
audit log *per device*. SHAL generates all of it from one topology.

**Is it production-ready?**
It's **alpha** (Phase 1). The synchronous core — topology, drivers, buses, retry
policy, and the agent tool surface — is real and tested. Async/streaming, the
actuator watchdog, and route failover are Phase 2 ([roadmap](#roadmap)).

**Do I need real hardware to try it?**
No. The bundled simulated bus runs the [Quick Start](#quick-start) with zero
hardware — swap in a real transport later, and your code doesn't change.

---

## Roadmap

**Shipped — Phase 1 (synchronous core, v0.1.0):**

- ✅ Declarative YAML topology: JSON-Schema validation, `id`/`path`/`$ref`,
  `${ENV}` secrets, reusable `template:` includes
- ✅ Bundled buses: `sim-i2c`, `local`, `ssh-host`, `i2c-cli`, `spi-cli`,
  `tcp` (TLS), `http`, `nxp,pca9548` mux
- ✅ Capability model, driver plugin registry, trustworthy retry policy
- ✅ Agent tool surface: `tool_schemas()` / `tool_catalog()` / `call_tool()`
- ✅ Human-in-the-loop actuation gate: actuator ops stop for an injectable
  `Approver` (pre-I/O, unbypassable, every decision audited)
- ✅ Structured observability + `capture()` flight recorder

**Designed, in progress — Phase 2:**

- 🚧 Async / streaming (`subscribe`, held channels) — [spec](https://github.com/determlab/shal/blob/main/docs/design/DESIGN%20-%20PHASE%202%20ASYNC.md)
- 🚧 Actuator watchdog & safe-state (timeouts, auto safe-state on disconnect)
- 🚧 Route failover for multi-path devices
